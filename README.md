Write Why make this app
  
  When I was Newbie of a job of Engineer, I made this apps for me. 
  My feelings is not stable (but everyone too) and I want to be more positive to live, and so I made feeling watch apps.
  Now, I don't have this programs and I want to make it to scratch, and now I think it is for linux CLI apps by ShellScript and C++, too.
  I am not many-knowledge-programmer or still not make program, but I thought it is nice to first my programs.

  If you want to brushup this apps, let me know your thoughts and it is train myself for me. It will be train for me, so it's wellcome!

About This App

  It is CLI app for Linux (maybe) and it will make by ShellScript. and if I can, I will make by C++ too.
  Start your terminal by ./XXXX and you will input Y/N, Yes or No, and program will makes you more positive.
  
*Still it is just my idea, and if you interested this, it's my delight!
